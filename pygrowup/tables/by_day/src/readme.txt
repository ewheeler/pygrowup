For clarity (for this author's, at least), the files have been renamed thus:

* acanthro.txt => arm_circumference_for_age.txt
* bmianthro.txt => bmi_for_age.txt
* hcanthro.txt => head_circumference_for_age.txt
* lenanthro.txt => length_for_age.txt
* ssanthro.txt => subscapular_skinfold_for_age.txt
* tsanthro.txt => triceps_skinfold_for_age.txt
* weianthro.txt => weight_for_age.txt
* wfhanthro.txt => weight_for_height.txt
* wflanthro.txt => weight_for_length.txt


Quoting the source's README regarding how to parse sex:
    sex: the name of the variable containing gender information; if it is
    numeric, its values must be: 1 for males and 2 for females.
